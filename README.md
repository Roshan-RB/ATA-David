**Enhancing Cognitive Efficiency in CAD-Based Cost Estimation for Sheet Metal Components Using OCR and Human-Centric Interfaces: A Step Toward Industry 5.0**

***Abstract***

In the realm of manufacturing, efficient cost estimation from CAD drawings is crucial for optimizing resource allocation and maintaining competitive advantage. ATA, a company specializing in the production of machine and plant parts, faced significant challenges with their manual, time-intensive process for extracting dimensions from CAD drawings, which involved entering data into spreadsheets for material cost estimation. This process required substantial cognitive effort and was prone to human error. In response, we developed a human-centric, Industry 5.0-aligned Streamlit application that leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to detect and display dimensions from CAD drawings. The user then interacts with the application to manually select and extract relevant dimensions into a structured DataFrame, thereby ensuring control over the extraction process while reducing cognitive load. This selective interaction embodies the principles of Industry 5.0 by enhancing human-machine collaboration and enabling operators of various skill levels to participate in the process. Our solution streamlines data extraction, minimizes errors, and improves operator efficiency, paving the way for a more accessible and adaptive cost estimation workflow. This paper discusses the design, implementation, and impact of this application, highlighting its alignment with Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0 principles.
